# HeavyBall - Benchmark

This test suite is meant to have fast execution, with each test case covering different optimization properties.

## Categories

Each test is tagged with categories describing specific optimization challenges:

- **Gradient Properties**
  - Magnitude: Exploding/vanishing gradients
  - Quality: Weak/noisy/sparse/delayed signals
  - Direction: Adversarial/misleading patterns

- **Landscape Navigation**
  - Topology: Valleys, plateaus, saddle points
  - Complexity: Multimodality, nonconvexity
  - Dynamics: Moving targets, shifting optima

- **Numerical Challenges**
  - Conditioning: Ill-conditioned problems
  - Scaling: Parameter scale variations
  - Stability: Numerical overflow/underflow

- **Learning Dynamics**
  - Memory: Long-term dependencies
  - Interaction: Multiplicative effects
  - Compression: Information bottlenecks
